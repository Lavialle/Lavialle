## Hi there 👋

I am Ange Lavialle. This is where I build, experiment, and break things on purpose.


I am currently pursuing a Master of Science in Data for Finance, a joint degree between Albert School and Mines Paris – PSL.
While I would not describe myself as an expert programmer yet, I am actively working to become better.

I am involved in projects related to RAG, Agentic System Design, and large language models, although I have a strong preference for classical supervised machine learning approaches.

Main programming languages and tools:

- Python
- R
- HTML/CSS
- SQL (PostgreSQL)
